### Unsupervised Learning: Segmentation and Clustering of US Used Car Sales Data 

### ABSTRACT 

This research study employs unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze a substantial dataset of US car sales from 2021. The dataset is carefully preprocessed, resulting in a refined set of 17 key parameters. A 10% subsample of the data is used for segmentation and clustering, utilizing various clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques. The t-SNE reduced MiniBatch K-Means algorithm demonstrates the most promising results, producing a Silhouette score of 0.39, indicating effective data segmentation. The model identifies three distinct clusters, revealing insights into the US car market segments based on year, price, odometer, and condition. However, due to computational limitations, the full dataset remains unexplored.

This study contributes to understanding US car sales data, particularly in the context of used cars' condition and values, enabling strategic decision-making in the automotive industry. It highlights the potential of unsupervised learning methods in deriving valuable insights from large-scale datasets and paves the way for future research in this area. The segmented clusters generated by the unsupervised learning algorithm can enhance future prediction and classification models, showcasing the significance of this approach.

### RESEARCH QUESTION:

Can the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques identify distinct patterns or trends in the pricing and demand of various types of used cars in the 2021 market?
