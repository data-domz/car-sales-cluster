# Historical Used Car Sales - Clustering and Unsupervised Learning 

### ABSTRACT 

In this data science project, we delve into an extensive analysis of historical sales of used cars across the United States, exploring key characteristics and trends. The dataset, comprising both categorical and continuous variables, offers rich insights into various aspects of the used car market. We employ unsupervised learning techniques, primarily clustering methods such as K-means and DBSCAN, to identify inherent groupings within the data. This categorization facilitates a detailed visualization of sales trends, presenting distinct patterns and structures that are otherwise invisible in raw, unsegmented data. Furthermore, these cluster identifications serve as a foundation for predictive modeling, aiming to forecast car prices and other associated parameters. Overall, our study presents a comprehensive, data-driven perspective on the U.S. used car market, unveiling its complexity and helping to forecast future trends.
